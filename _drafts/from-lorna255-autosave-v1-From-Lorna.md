I first met Frankie at “The Northern” in Manchester. We were 14 years old.

We met around the Junior Circuit, and then continued round the ‘senior’ (which in those days meant over 18 yrs. old.). It was during these tournaments that we became real friends.

We used to borrow each other’s clothes, being more or less the same size, and spent as much of our leisure time together as possible.

France’s then dropped out of tennis and began working like a normal person. We had to pay to play tennis in those days!

I continued playing, then got married and Frankie (as I always knew her) came to stay the week I had my first baby since my husband had to be away. Within an hour of two of her arrival I was off to hospital and my first baby Trudy was born.

We of course remained in touch and when my second baby Zoe was born she became her godmother.  
Then I invited her to stay when I was expecting my third! Within a few hours Kerry my third daughter appeared. Frankie couldn’t understand why my husband kept coming into her room from 06.30am onwards offering her cups of tea! Kerry had been born at 06.00hrs.

We saw each other whenever her job, and my family and tennis permitted, then even when Frankie was living in Hong Kong we met whenever we could when we were both in the UK. Difficult, as I was also travelling.

We saw each other in each other’s various homes around the world, and I even eventually made it to Hong Kong.

A kinder, and more faithful friend would be impossible to find. Her elegance, talents in interior design, cookery, and languages were there for all to see and appreciate. We also shared the sense of competitiveness and sense of humour too.

I cannot believe she is no longer with us and love and miss her profoundly.  
Au revoir Frankie
