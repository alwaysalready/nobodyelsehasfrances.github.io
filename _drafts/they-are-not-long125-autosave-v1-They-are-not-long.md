<div style="font-size: smaller;">by Ernest Dowson</div>   
THEY are not long, the weeping and the laughter,  
Love and desire and hate:  
I think they have no portion in us after  
We pass the gate.

They are not long, the days of wine and roses:  
Out of a misty dream  
Our path emerges for awhile, then closes  
Within a dream.

<div style="font-size: smaller;">Frances sent this poem to Caroline and Stephen in 2013.</div>
