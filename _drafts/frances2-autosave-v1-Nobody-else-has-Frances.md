[Lots of people are stronger than me,  
With greater athletic menaces;  
They poise like gods on diving boards  
And win their golfs and tennises.  
Lots of people have lots more grace  
And cut fine figures at dances,  
While I was born with galoshes on â€”  
But nobody else has Frances.](http://nobodyelsehasfrances.fr/traced-on-a-birthday-cake/)
