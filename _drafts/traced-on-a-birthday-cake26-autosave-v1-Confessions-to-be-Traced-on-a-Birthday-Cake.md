Lots of people are richer than me,  
Yet pay a slenderer tax;  
Their annual levy seems to wane  
While their income seems to wax.  
Lots of people have stocks and bonds  
To further their romances;  
I’ve cashed my ultimate Savings Stamp —  
But nobody else has Frances.

Lots of people are stronger than me,  
With greater athletic menaces;  
They poise like gods on diving boards  
And win their golfs and tennises.  
Lots of people have lots more grace  
And cut fine figures at dances,  
While I was born with galoshes on —  
But nobody else has Frances.

Lots of people are wiser than me,  
And carry within their cranium  
The implications of Stein and Joyce  
And the properties of uranium.  
They know the mileage to every star  
In the heaven’s vast expanses;  
I’m inclined to believe that the world is flat —  
But nobody else has Frances.

Speaking of wisdom and wealth and grace —  
As recently I have dared to —  
There are lots of people compared to whom  
I’d rather not be compared to.  
There are people I ought to wish I was;  
But under the circumstances,  
I prefer to continue my life as me —  
For nobody else has Frances.
